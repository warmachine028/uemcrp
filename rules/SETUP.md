**Hello contributor, i want you to stick to the below listed Setup guidelines to successfully setup the react app in your local system and get started with developing!!**

- Check if your branch is behind the original branch.
- Always update the branch with original branch `uemcrp:main` before starting any new developement.
- `Fork` the repo to your account.
- Open Git bash in a folder.
